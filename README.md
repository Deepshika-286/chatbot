# Chatbot:
This project is a medical chatbot designed to provide quick and basic first aid tips. It includes helpful advice on common medical situations such as sprains, cuts, strains, fever, CPR, and more.

## Overview
The chatbot is powered by a machine learning model trained on a dataset downloaded from Kaggle. The model is built using a Sequential Neural Network in TensorFlow (Keras). The primary goal of this chatbot is to assist users with basic first aid information and steps they can follow in emergency situations.

## Features
- Provides immediate first aid tips for common medical issues.

- Includes guidance for conditions like sprains, cuts, strains, fever, CPR, and more.

- Easy to integrate and use in applications.

- Built using machine learning for improved accuracy and responsiveness.

## Workflow
The overall process involves the following steps:

- Data Collection: A dataset containing first aid tips and medical advice is sourced from Kaggle.

- Data Pre-processing: Data is cleaned and pre-processed to prepare it for training.

- Model Creation: A Sequential Neural Network model is created using TensorFlow (Keras).

- Model Training: The model is trained using the processed data to understand user input and provide relevant responses.

- Chatbot creation: The trained model is integrated into the chatbot interface, allowing users to interact and receive instant first aid tips.

## Libraries Used
- TensorFlow (Keras): For building and training the neural network model.

- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For natural language processing tasks.

- Scikit-learn: For machine learning utilities like data splitting, vectorization, etc.

## Setup and Usage
This Python file can be run in Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or any other Python environment of your choice.

## Steps to Run:
1. Clone the repository:

        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medical-chatbot.git

2. Install the necessary libraries: You can install the required libraries using pip:

        pip install tensorflow nltk scikit-learn

3. Run the Python script: Simply run the main Python file (chatbot.py) to start interacting with the chatbot.

4. Chat with the bot: The chatbot will ask for your input, and it will respond with first aid tips based on the medical situation you describe.

## Contributions
Feel free to fork this repository, make improvements, or add additional medical conditions to expand the chatbotâ€™s functionality. U can also access colab link from the code.

### Hope this helps! Happy learning!!
